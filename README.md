Virtual assistants are software programs that help 
you ease your day to day tasks, such as showing 
weather reports, creating remainders, making 
shopping lists etc.
• They can take commands via text (online chatbots) 
or by voice.
• Voice-based intelligent assistants need an invoking 
word or wake word to activate the listener, followed 
by the command.
• Speech recognition is used to convert 
the speech input to text
